This project was created on Oct 2020.
This repo contains the code for the development and completion of the project.

In the beginning, we started by working on some of the examples online to learn more about the technical aspects required for the project. These are included inside `related_code` directory:
- `mnist` directory contains the code and data used to train and predict numeric hand writings. Dataset can be found at `https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png`
- `asean_dances` directory contains the code impoved to train real dance images collected from the internet. Dataset can be collected using code `scripts`.
- `scripts` directory contains the code to support us in getting a sizable number of dance images from Youtube to used in training and testing.

Finally, we used Google Colab to put everything to together and use it as a the source as final results. Link to our Google Colab notebook can be found here `https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZkU1BcZBYi79x10dHszokwcoYaAxZhJG?usp=sharing`.
